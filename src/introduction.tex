\section{Introduction}

Computer vision field has incredibly improved over last 5 years. This has been mainly thanks to the convoluional neural networks, which can be used for a wide variety of tasks. Their rise has been made possible by incresing computational power and using GPUs. Accecibility of huge datasets, such as ImageNet\cite{imagenet}, Pascal VOC \cite{pascal} are also very important for training. 


\section{State of the Art}
The task of image recognition has been quite solved, . The Inception network \cite{inception}
