This thesis deals with tracking vehicles over multiple non-overlapping cameras. The goal is to design and implement a system able to detect vehicles in a city environment and track their position. The cameras have a fish-eye view and are mounted to street lamps. We present a deep neural network for vehicle detection utilizing the video information, a single camera vehicle tracking algorithm based on optical flow, a deep neural network trained to compute similarities between vehicles and a probabilistic graph representation of a city. The conducted real world experiments verified the capability of the whole system.
